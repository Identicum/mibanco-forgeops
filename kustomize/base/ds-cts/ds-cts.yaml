    # Kubernetes secrets holding the certificates and keys for directory server operation.
    # Secrets can be generated by cert-manager or other tools that generate
    # PEM based secrets of type kubernetes.io/tls.
    secrets:
      # the tls.key in this secret is the private key used for encrypting DS data.
      # BACK THIS UP!! If you lose this secret your data will be lost forever.

      sslSecretName: ds-ssl-keypair
      # The truststore is taken from the ca.crt in the tls secret. In most cases
      # you can use the same CA trust pem in the ssl secret above. If you are using
      # cert-manager, it includes the CA trust pem along with the private/public key pair.

  ### Passwords ###
  # Passwords: maps DS accounts to new or existing secrets.
  # The operator supports "bring your own secrets". For example, a secret may have been generated by another operator such as secret agent.
  # A secret that does not set create: true is assumed to be supplied externally. External secrets will not be deleted by the operator
  passwords:
    # uid=admin and uid=monitor are required account secrets.
    uid=admin:
      secretName: ds-passwords
      key: dirmanager.pw
    uid=monitor:
      secretName: ds-passwords
      key: monitor.pw
      # example of letting the operator generate the secret:
      #create: true

    # Set the service account passwords
    uid=openam_cts,ou=admins,ou=famrecords,ou=openam-session,ou=tokens:
      secretName: ds-env-secrets
      key: AM_STORES_CTS_PASSWORD
